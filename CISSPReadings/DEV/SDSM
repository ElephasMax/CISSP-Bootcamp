This is a short list of processes and controls for security in SDLC from System Development Security Methodology by: Ian Lim , Ioana V. Bazavan Date 2010
from https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.1081/E-EIA-120046747#! 
This will not match other document stages but it is very CISSP centric. Each stage has short checklist of security componets. 
For a more detailed list and understanding look at https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-64/rev-2/archive/2008-10-16
Do not take the advice of NIST to convert to 800-160 until after you pass your CISSP exam.
